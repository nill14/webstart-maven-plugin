 * Packages a jnlp application.
 * <p/>
 * The plugin tries to not re-sign/re-pack if the dependent jar hasn't changed.
 * As a consequence, if one modifies the pom jnlp config or a keystore, one should clean before rebuilding.
 * <p/>This mojo forks a build lifecycle and won't install the zip packages in your local repository.
 * You probably want to use the jnlp-inline instead.
