Keystore generation and usage

  To deliver signed applications, one usually needs to generate a keystore.

  One can use the keytool command line program delivered as part of the SDK.
  Another way to create the keystore is to use the
  {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/keytool/}Keytool Project}} via his nice java api.
 
* Keytool as part of the Keytool Maven Plugin

  See the  {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/keytool/keytool-maven-plugin/}Keytool Maven Plugin}} documentation.

* Keytool as part of the Webstart Maven Plugin

  One can make the Webstart Plugin generate a new keystore at each build.
  This can be convenient for demos and other less production critical projects
  (where signing needs to be done appropriately).
