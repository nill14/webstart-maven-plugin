Notes to users and contributors

* Upcoming changes

  * {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MWEBSTART-58} Support for generating multiple bundles from one JNLP project}} (similar to what the <<<jnlp-download-servlet>>> goal does).

  * More generally some work is going to be done to make the JNLP goals configuration more compatible.

* Reported missing features

   * {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MWEBSTART-25} A mojo for deploying the bundles to a remote server}}

   * {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MWEBSTART-24} A mojo for running the application}}

   * More control on the dependencies: {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MWEBSTART-72} JarResource exclusions}} and {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MWEBSTART-90} control of the transitivity}}

   * More support for standalone Web Start apps (e.g. <<<download.html/index.html>>>)

   * Handling of {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MWEBSTART-8} native libraries}}

* Other ideas

   * Building multiple JNLP apps in one zip using one Maven 2 project? (not sure as this is not a very Maven way of doing things)

      * Would require merging <<<version.xml>>>

   * What about deploying multiple versions of the same app? Is that ever wanted, e.g. for upgrades?

   * Add a new goal to help deal with web applications?

      * One step WAR+webstart generation (one project, Webstart Plugin used in <<<pre-package>>> phase)

      * More WAR integration (JNLP, <<<web.xml>>>)
