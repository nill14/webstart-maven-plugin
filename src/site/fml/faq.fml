    <faq id="obfuscation_question">
      <question>Can the Webstart plugin obfuscate JARs and deploy them?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The plugin doesn't obfuscate JARs but it can deploy JARs that have already been obfuscated. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One approach would be to use the <a href="http://pyx4me.com/pyx4me-maven-plugins/proguard-maven-plugin/introduction.html">proguard-maven-plugin</a>
          to obfuscate the JARs and the <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/">build-helper-maven-plugin</a>
          to attach the obfuscated artifact to the project along with the unobfuscated JAR and install them both in 
          your local repository. Then when you configure the Webstart Plugin with the dependencies to be deployed in 
          your JNLP bundle, you can choose between the obfuscated or unobfuscated JARs.

    <faq id="get_jnlp_download_servlet">
      <question>Where can I get the JNLP Download Servlet?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The servlet cannot yet be found on an central Maven repository. For demonstration purposes, the webstart project packages one version under the (currently) following identifiers
<pre>
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo.webstart-maven-plugin&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;!--groupId&gt;com.sun.java.jnlp&lt;/groupId--&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;jnlp-servlet&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.0-6.0-02_ea_b02-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
</pre>
         but most probably you will have to retrieve it from Sun's web site or from your local SDK installation (>= Java 5). See also the <a href="jnlp101.html">JNLP 101</a>.

    <faq id="deploy_jnlp">
      <question>How can I deploy my JNLP application to my server?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Right now, deployment is not supported out of the box by the plugin. We may add the support in the near future (See <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MWEBSTART-25">MWEBSTART-25</a>). You may want to use the <a href="http://myfaces.apache.org/wagon-maven-plugin/usage.html">Wagon Maven Plugin</a> in the mean time.
